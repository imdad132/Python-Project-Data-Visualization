# Project Description 
This Python project is building an interactive map to visualize immigration to Canada from different countries using data from the UN data sources. It uses Folium for mapping, GeoJSON for country shapes, Choropleth for visualization, and Pandas for data manipulation. 

# Objectives
The purpose is to draw a geo-spatial map showing the immigration trends Canada. 

# Output
AS a final product, you get an interactive world map showing immigration to Canada from 1980â€“2013.
Countries with more immigrants are coloured darker (e.g., India, China, Philippines).
You can zoom, pan, and hover over countries to explore the data.

# Python Learning 
This script creates a visual, interactive world map to explore historical immigration trends to Canada. It combines:

## Folium for mapping
## Pandas for data manipulation
## GeoJSON for country shapes
## Choropleth for visualizing totals
